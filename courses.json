Motion & Rest2. One dimensional motion3. Graphs4. Laws of motion5. Gravitation“In the 1st section we’re going to learn absolute and relative rest and motion.Difference b/w Distance & Displacement.Rate that tells Speed & Velocity and finally rate of velocity which is Acceleration. In this section we will learn and get clear about Rest & Motion and all the basics you’re gonna need to start understanding stop and moving.”“In section 2 We’re going to learn One dimensional motion in which we will explore all the equations of motion that will take our knowledge to the next level. We are going to learn its derivation & its practical application that you’re going to solve with me..”“In 3rd Section we will explore Graphs.Increasing, decreasing, uniform, Non- uniform motions. We’re gonna see slope and area of the graphs. We’re gonna see displacement time, velocity time and acceleration time graph & to represent motion and rest by graphs. So there’s a lot to grasp and that much fun”“In Section 4 we’re going to see the Laws of Motion and meet with great minds.. Galileo, Kepler, Aristotle & Our Friend Newton. We’re going to learn Parabola and Trajectory path and its motion and after this you will able to calculate and understand what actually happen when a ball is thrown up and horizontal (2 dimensionally) and finally we will learn all the 3 most famous laws of motion gave by Newton. This section has packed fun that is waiting to unwrap by you”“In Section 5 we’re going to learn Gravitation one of the greatest discovery in Mankind. Its understanding started with ground and take off to the launching of Satellites and Rockets. In this section we’re going to explore all this amazing science.
