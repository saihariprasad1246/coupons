Motion & Rest2. One dimensional motion3. Graphs4. Laws of motion5. Gravitation“In the 1st section we’re going to learn absolute and relative rest and motion.Difference b/w Distance & Displacement.Rate that tells Speed & Velocity and finally rate of velocity which is Acceleration. In this section we will learn and get clear about Rest & Motion and all the basics you’re gonna need to start understanding stop and moving.”“In section 2 We’re going to learn One dimensional motion in which we will explore all the equations of motion that will take our knowledge to the next level. We are going to learn its derivation & its practical application that you’re going to solve with me..”“In 3rd Section we will explore Graphs.Increasing, decreasing, uniform, Non- uniform motions. We’re gonna see slope and area of the graphs. We’re gonna see displacement time, velocity time and acceleration time graph & to represent motion and rest by graphs. So there’s a lot to grasp and that much fun”“In Section 4 we’re going to see the Laws of Motion and meet with great minds.. Galileo, Kepler, Aristotle & Our Friend Newton. We’re going to learn Parabola and Trajectory path and its motion and after this you will able to calculate and understand what actually happen when a ball is thrown up and horizontal (2 dimensionally) and finally we will learn all the 3 most famous laws of motion gave by Newton. This section has packed fun that is waiting to unwrap by you”“In Section 5 we’re going to learn Gravitation one of the greatest discovery in Mankind. Its understanding started with ground and take off to the launching of Satellites and Rockets. In this section we’re going to explore all this amazing science. So join now and master the art of Physics”With section wise breakup & indepth lessons that make it interactive & easy to learn.

I built this application using React, JavaScript, Firebase and for styling I used Tailwind CSS (which is amazing). You will need knowledge of React to not struggle on this tutorial (useState, useEffect, useContext) and you will need some knowledge of JavaScript to get you by.You need to have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.During the course we are going to use latest version of React – React 18.As far as concepts we are going to cover",

    "description": "Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification or genetic manipulation, is the modification and manipulation of an organism’s genes using technology. It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel organisms. New DNA is obtained by either isolating or copying the genetic material of interest using recombinant DNA methods or by artificially synthesizing the DNA. A construct is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by Paul Berg in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus SV40 with the lambda virus. As well as inserting genes, the process can be used to remove, or “knock out”, genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or targeted to a specific part of the genome.Importance of Recombinant DNA Technology & Genetic EngineeringGenetic modification allows changes in genes to transfer genetic material in different organisms. It is possible to introduce foreign genes into crop plants and express these in specific tissues. Transfer of genes can help to improve crop protection. Genetic modification can be done with various viral and non viral methods. Direct manipulation of DNA sequences can lead to different expression levels. Choosing the best method for gene delivery can be a difficult task, particularly to transfer genetic material in a proper way. This review highlights, basic mechanism and importance and different methods used for efficient gene delivery. Hence, understanding of intracellular machinery plays a crucial role for designing a more effective gene delivery environment.Job ScopeJobs directly related to your degree include:Jobs where your degree would be useful include:Salary Range Provided in Genetic Engineering field:Candidate in jobs or training period ranges from 2-2.8 Lakh per annumFor research associate, it ranges from 3.5 lakh to 5 lakh per year.Junior scientists vary from 6-9 lakh per annumWhereas for a senior scientist, it varies between 15-16 lakh per annum in private companies.Not only in India but in foreign also if you are looking for a career the average annual base salary is $159,339 to $194,895 of geneticists in the USA. For example, a doctoral researcher gets a package of more than 22 lakh per annum (i.e. € 29,060/ year) whereas for postdoctoral researchers more than 50 Lakh per annum (€50,525/year). As the experience in this field increases, the salary packages offered in both private and government sector increases.Who can enroll?· Students pursuing their Life Science / Biotechnology / Bioscience / BSc / BTech / MSc / MTech who aspire to work in the clinical research field.What Benefits are you going to get from this course?",
